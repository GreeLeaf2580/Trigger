## Update Log

I rebuilt the command system with new function architecture, redesigned most Grade 2-3 levels, and added an NPC avatar of the creator. This massive overhaul relaunches the map as a brand-new resource!

## Author's Note

I' m **GreeLeaf**. This map is the third entry in the **[​1 word, 10 worlds]**. The second entry **[​Rotation]** was featured in an event, and the first **[​Hole]** was co-developed. Both will return after optimizations.A tribute to parkour & minigame creator **[​RipplingWheat]**. "I’ll wait here for your return." (Update: Found their contact info in old archives – happy ending unlocked! 🎉)
